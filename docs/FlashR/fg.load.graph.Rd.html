<h2>Load a graph to FlashR.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Load a graph to FlashR from difference sources.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
fg.load.graph(graph, index.file = NULL, graph.name = graph,
  directed = TRUE, nthreads = 1)

fg.load.igraph(graph, graph.name = paste("igraph-v", vcount(graph), "-e",
  ecount(graph), sep = ""), nthreads = 1)

fg.get.graph(graph.name)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph file or the input iGraph object.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>index.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input index file for the graph. A user only needs
to provide an index file if the input graph uses
the FlashGraph format.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph name a user provides when a graph is
loaded to FlashR.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicate whether the input graph is directed. This is
only used if the input graph use the edge list format.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nthreads</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of threads used to construct a graph to
the FlashGraph format.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>&lsquo;fg.load.graph&rsquo; loads a graph from the following sources: an edge list
file in the text format and an adjacency list file in the FlashGraph format.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;fg.load.igraph&rsquo; loads a graph from an iGraph object.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;fg.get.graph&rsquo; gets a FlashGraph object that references a graph
that has been loaded to FlashR.
</p>
<p>Once a graph is loaded to FlashR, FlashR will maintain it.
A user can use fg.list.graphs() to list all graphs that have been loaded
FlashR and use fg.get.graph() to get a reference to a graph. A user
should provide a name for the graph so later on he or she will be able
to identify the graph more easily. By default, the graph name is
the input graph file name.
</p>
<p>A graph in the FlashGraph format is stored in two files: a FlashGraph
adjacency list file and a FlashGraph index file. When a user provides
an index file, the input graph file is considered as an adjacency list
file, otherwise, an edge list file.
</p>
<p>When loading a graph from an edge list file, FlashR will construct
it into the FlashGraph format. A user needs to indicate whether the edge
list represents a directed graph. A user can also use multiple threads
to accelerate constructing a graph.
</p>
<p>When loading a graph from iGraph, FlashR
will construct it into the FlashGraph format. A user can use multiple
threads to accelerate graph construction.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a FlashGraph object.
