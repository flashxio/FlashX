Generate an induced subgraph

Description:

     Generate an induced subgraph that contains the specified vertices
     from the input given graph.

Usage:

     fg.fetch.subgraph.igraph(graph, vertices)
     
     fg.fetch.subgraph(graph, vertices, name = paste(graph$name, "-sub", sep = ""))
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

vertices: A numeric vector that contains the ids of vertices in the
          induced subgraph.

    name: The name of the FlashGraphR object.

Details:

     `fg.fetch.subgraph.igraph' generates the induced subgraph and
     converts it into an iGraph object

     `fg.fetch.subgraph' generates the induced subgraph and returns a
     FlashGraphR object.

Value:

     `fg.fetch.subgraph.igraph' returns an iGraph object,
     `fg.fetch.subgraph' returns a FlashGraph object
