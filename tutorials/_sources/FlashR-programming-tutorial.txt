FlashR programming tutorial
===========================

FlashR is an extension of the R programming framework. It executes R
code in parallel automatically and stores and accesses arrays in the R
code on disks automatically to scale R to large datasets that can't fit
in memory. The core of FlashR is a small set of generalized operators to
perform computation in an array-oriented fashion. In addition to the
generalized operators, FlashR reimplements many commonly used R
functions to provide users a familiar R programming environment to
reduce the learning curve. FlashR is completely implemented as an R
package.

FlashR is designed with goals in four aspects:

-  Efficiency: Comparable to optimized C code.
-  Scalability: Tera-scale or larger.
-  Generality: as many applications as possible in data mining and
   machine learning and more.
-  Productivity: the same productivity as R.

Although FlashR tries to provide a familiar environment for R users,
some operations in the traditional R are not supported in FlashR. The
biggest difference is that FlashR does not allow users to modify
individual elements in a vector or a matrix. FlashR intentionally
chooses so for the sake of performance. FlashR stores vectors and
matrices on SSDs. Modifying individual elements results in
read-modify-write to SSDs, which causes many small random I/O. It causes
efficiency issues and these operations are harmful to SSDs. By
forbidding modifying individual elements, FlashR advocates
array-oriented programming to achieve superior efficiency.

How to start
------------

Users can follow the
`instructions <https://github.com/icoming/FlashX/wiki/FlashX-Quick-Start-Guide>`__
to install FlashR in Ubuntu. To load FlashR to R, run

::

    > library(FlashR)

Construct FlashR vectors and matrices
-------------------------------------

FlashR provides a set of functions to generate FlashR vectors and
matrices. These functions have very similar interface as the R
counterparts that generate vectors and matrices.

-  ``fm.rep.int``: Create a vector with replicated elements. e.g.,
   ``fm.rep.int(1, 10)`` creates a FlashR vector with 10 elements and
   each element is 1.
-  ``fm.seq.int``: Create a vector with a sequence of numbers. e.g.,
   ``fm.seq.int(1, 10, 1)`` creates a FlashR vector with a sequence of
   numbers between [1:10].
-  ``fm.runif``: Create a vector with uniformly random numbers. e.g.,
   ``fm.runif(10, 0, 1)`` creates a FlashR vector with 10 uniformly
   random values between 0 and 1.
-  ``fm.matrix``: Create a matrix from a FlashR vector. e.g.,
   ``fm.matrix(vec, 10, 2)`` creates a 10x2 FlashR matrix from a FlashR
   vector.

FlashR also provides functions to access vectors and matrices from the
filesystem.

-  ``fm.read.obj``: Read a FlashR object (vector/matrix) from a Linux
   file.
-  ``fm.write.obj``: Write a FlashR object (vector/matrix) to a Linux
   file.

Interact with native R
----------------------

FlashR also provides functions to interact with the original R system.

-  ``fm.as.vector``: convert an R vector to a FlashR vector.
-  ``fm.as.matrix``: convert an R matrix to a FlashR matrix.
-  ``as.vector``: convert a FlashR vector to a R vector.
-  ``as.matrix``: convert a FlashR matrix to a R matrix.

FlashR has the following functions for users to test if an object is a
FlashR vector or matrix.

-  ``fm.is.vector``: test if an object is a FlashR vector.
-  ``fm.is.matrix``: test if an object is a FlashR matrix.

Generalized operators
---------------------

| FlashR has two sets of programming API. It provides users a set of
  generalized operators, with which users can implement varieties of
  data mining and machine learning algorithms. On top of them, FlashR
  implements many R functions in the base package with the generalized
  operators to mimic the original R programming environment.
| Generalized operators

Generalized operators (GenOp) are the core of FlashR. There are a very
small number of GenOps in FlashR. Each operator accepts a user-defined
operator (UDO) or the name of a UDO to perform users' tasks. Currently,
there are four GenOps, but some of them have multiple forms. There are
many UDOs in FlashR such as addition and subtraction (see
``?fm.basic.op`` for details). Below lists all GenOps currently
supported by FlashR.

**Inner product**: a generalized matrix multiplication. It replaces
multiplication and addition in matrix multiplication with two UDOs,
respectively. As such, we can define many operations with inner product.
For example, we can use inner product to compute various pair-wise
distance matrics of data points such as Euclidean distance and Hamming
distance.

::

    fm.inner.prod(fm, mat, FUN1, FUN2)

| One example of using ``fm.inner.prod`` is to compute a pair-wise
  distance between every data point. ``fm.bo.euclidean`` and
  ``fm.bo.add`` are some UDOs written in C++. ``fm.bo.euclidean``
  computes ``(x-y)*(x-y)``. ``fm.bo.add`` computes ``x + y``.
| ``fm.inner.prod(data, t(data), fm.bo.euclidean, fm.bo.add)``

**Apply**: a generalized form of element-wise operations and has
multiple variants.

-  ``fm.sapply``: a generalized element-wise unary operation whose UDO
   takes an element in a vector or a matrix at a time and outputs an
   element.
-  ``fm.mapply2``: a generalized element-wise binary operation whose UDO
   takes an element from each vector or matrix and outputs an element.
-  ``fm.mapply.row`` and ``fm.mapply.col`` are two variants of
   ``fm.mapply2``. They are similar to ``sweep()`` in R and the
   broadcasting mechanism in Numpy. They are equivalent to mapply2 on
   every row or column of the matrix (in the first argument) with the
   vector (in the second argument). Currently, ``fm.mapply.row`` and
   ``fm.mapply.col`` only accept the cases that the vector has the same
   length as a row or a column of the matrix.

   ::

       fm.sapply(o, FUN)
       fm.mapply2(o1, o2, FUN)
       fm.mapply.row(o1, o2, FUN)
       fm.mapply.col(o1, o2, FUN)

| Many matrix operations in FlashR are implemented with ``fm.sapply``
  and ``fm.mapply2``.
| Example 1: compute m1 + m2
| ``fm.mapply2.fm(m1, m2, fm.bo.add)``

| Example 2: compute -m1
| ``fm.sapply(m1, fm.buo.neg)``

These are some examples of using ``fm.sapply`` and ``fm.mapply2``. Both
matrix addition and matrix negation have been implemented in FlashR.

Aggregation takes multiple elements and outputs a single element.

-  ``fm.agg``: aggregates over the entire vector or matrix.
-  ``fm.agg.mat``: aggregates over each individual row or column of a
   matrix and outputs a vector.

   ::

       fm.agg(fm, FUN)
       fm.agg.mat(fm, margin, FUN)

| Example 1: compute sum(m)
| ``fm.agg(x, fm.bo.add)``

| Example 2: compute rowSums(m)
| ``fm.agg.mat(x, 1, fm.bo.add)``

Again, both ``sum()`` and ``rowSums()`` have been implemented with
aggregation in FlashR.

| Groupby is similar to groupby in SQL. It groups multiple elements by
  their values and perform some computation on the elements. Currently,
  the function passed to a groupby function has to aggregate values.
| ``fm.sgroupby``: groups elements by their values in a vector and
  invokes UDO on the elements associated with the same value. It outputs
  a vector.
| ``fm.groupby``: takes a matrix and a vector of categorical values,
  groups rows/columns of the matrix based on the corresponding
  categorical value and runs UDO on the rows/columns with the same
  categorical value. It outputs a matrix.

::

    fm.sgroupby(o, FUN)
    fm.groupby(fm, margin, factor, FUN)

| In practice, groupby requires an aggregation operation over some of
  the original elements in a group and combine operation over the
  aggregation results. The reason is that groupby runs in parallel and
  each time it can only aggregate over some of the elements in a group.
  Essentially, the combine operation is an aggregation. Usually, it is
  sufficient to pass a UDO to a groupby function because a UDO can work
  as both aggregation and combine. In some cases, however, we need these
  operations to be different. As such, users can pass an aggregation
  operator to groupby. A user can create an aggregation operator
  themselves by calling fm.create.agg.op() and specify two UDOs for the
  aggregation and combine operation.
| fm.create.agg.op(agg, combine, name)

"Base" R functions
------------------

FlashR implements many R functions in the base package to mimic the R
programming environment. Although we have a goal of having these
functions as similar as possible to the original R functions, we do not
provide 100% compatibility with the original R version for some
functions. Overall, we try to provide similarity under the condition of
not sacrificing performance. Below shows a list of R functions in the
base package currently supported by FlashR. In the future, more
functions will be provided.

The following functions have exactly the same interface as the original
R function.

-  dim, nrow, ncol, length, typeof, t
-  abs, sqrt, ceiling, floor, round, log, log2, log10, exp

The following functions have exactly the same interface as the original
R functions. When they are applied to a matrix and a vector, it requires
the vector has the same length as the columns in the matrix.

-  +, -, *, /, %*\ %
-  ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, !

The following functions have exactly the same interface as the original
R functions, but currently we don't support some functionality such as
removing missing values.

-  sum, min, max, mean, sd, pmin, pmax
-  rowSums, colSums, rowMeans, colMeans

Some of them have slightly different interface and semantics. These
slightly different functions always start with "fm." to indicate that
they are actually FlashR functions. In the future, we will provide
implementations with exactly the same interface and semantics as the
original R functions.

-  fm.table
-  fm.as.integer, fm.as.numeric

Some examples of using FlashR
-----------------------------

| PageRank is the classical algorithm to rank Web pages originally used
  by Google search engine. PageRank is an iterative algorithm. In each
  iteration, the PageRank value of a vertex is updated as follow:
| PR(p\_i) = \\frac{1-d}{N} + d \\sum\_{p\_j \\in M(p\_i)} \\frac{PR
  (p\_j)}{L(p\_j)}
| As such, the PageRank algorithm is implemented as follows:

.. code:: r

    pr1 <- fm.rep.int(1/N, N)
    converge <- 0
    while (converge < N) {
     pr2 <- (1-d)/N+d*(A %*% (pr1/out.deg))
     diff <- abs(pr1-pr2)
     converge <- sum(diff < epsilon)
     pr1 <- pr2
    }

| Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) factorizes a matrix to two
  non-negative matrices. The following code implements the algorithm
  described in the Lee's paper.
| The update rules described in Lee's paper are implemented as follow

.. code:: r

    den <- (t(W) %*% W) %*% H
    H <- fm.pmax2(H * t(tA %*% W), eps) / (den + eps)
    den <- W %*% (H %*% t(H))
    W <- fm.pmax2(W * (A %*% t(H)), eps) / (den + eps)

One of the convergence condition is \|\|A - WH\|\|2. It is
computationally expensive to compute the Frobenius norm of (A-WH)
directly. Suppose A is a n×m matrix, W is a n×k matrix and H is a k×m
matrix. The computation complexity is O(n×k×m). Therefore, instead of
computing the Frobenius norm, we compute trace((A-WH)T(A-WH)) =
trace(ATA) -2*trace((ATW)H)+trace((HT(WTW))H). We need to order the
matrix multiplication in a certain way to reduce computation complexity.
The computation complexity of (ATW)H is O(l*\ k), where l is the number
of non-zero entries in A. The computation complexity of (HT(WTW))H is
O(k2×n+k2×m).

.. code:: r

    # trace of W %*% H
    trace.MM <- function(W, H) {
     X <- W * t(H)
     sum(X)
    }

    # ||A - W %*% H||^2
    Fnorm <- function(A, W, H) {
     sum(A*A) - 2 * trace.MM(t(A) %*% W, H) + trace.MM(t(H) %*% (t(W) %*% W), H)
    }

| KMeans is another iterative algorithm that cluster data pointers. In
  an iteration, it has three steps and below are the steps and the
  corresponding FlashR code.
| Step 1: calculate distances between all data points to all cluster
  centers.

.. code:: r

    m <- fm.inner.prod(data, t(centers), fm.bo.euclidean, fm.bo.add)

Step 2: find the closest cluster center for each data point.

.. code:: r

    parts <- fm.as.integer(fm.agg.mat(m, 1, agg.which.min) - 1)

Step 3: update all cluster centers.

.. code:: r

    centers <- as.matrix(fm.groupby(data, 2, parts, agg.sum))
    cnts <- fm.table(parts)
    centers <- diag(1/cnts$Freq) %*% centers

Requirements for FlashR users
-----------------------------

| There are two requirements for FlashR users to get the best
  performance out of FlashR:
| Array-oriented programming
| Understand space & computation complexity
