There are two main components in the repository: FlashGraph and SAFS.

FlashGraph
===========

FlashGraph is a semi-external memory graph processing engine, optimized for a high-speed
SSD array. FlashGraph provides flexible programming interface to help users implement
graph algorithms. In FlashGraph, users write serial code that reads data in memory
and FlashGraph executes users' code in parallel and out of core.
It enables us to process a billion-node graph in a single machine
and has performance comparable to or exceed in-memory graph engines such as
[PowerGraph](http://graphlab.org/).

FlashGraph provides R bindings called FlashGraphR to help domain experts use FlashGraph.
FlashGraphR has a wrapper for each graph algorithm implemented in FlashGraph. Domain
experts can use FlashGraph to perform expensive graph algorithms and use the comprehensive
R libraries to further analyze the result generated by FlashGraph. This combination provides
domain experts to a powerful tool to analyze massive graphs (millions or even billions of
vertices) very efficiently. FlashGraphR is further integrated with [iGraph] (http://igraph.org/)
so that users can convert a FlashGraphR object to an iGraph object easily and vice versa.

SAFS
========

`SAFS` is an open-source library that provides a filesystem-like interface
in the userspace to help users access a large SSD array in a
[NUMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access) machine.
It is designed to eliminate overhead in the block subsystem in Linux, without modifying the kernel,
and achieves the maximal performance of a large SSD array in a NUMA machine.
FlashGraph is an application to demonstrate the power of SAFS.
